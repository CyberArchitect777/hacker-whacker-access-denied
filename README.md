# Hacker Whacker: Access Denied
## By Barrie Millar
### A Themed Whack-A-Mole Style Game

## Introduction

Welcome to Hacker Whacker: Access Denied, an extension on the original whack-a-mole style game Hacker Whacker. Three developers were involved in creating the original and are credited in the Team section. Of those three, only Barrie Millar is involved in this expansion.

The original game was created during Hackathon 2 of Code Institute's "16-Week High-Performance Full Stack Skills Bootcamp" which ranged from 02/07/2024 (from 9am) to 04/07/2024 (up to 1.30pm). The purpose of this extension is to progress the project beyond the scope of the assessment and to add features that the developers originally wanted to include.
