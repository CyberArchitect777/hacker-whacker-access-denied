## Version 1.0.1
## By Barrie Millar
### A Themed Whack-A-Mole Style Game

## Introduction

Welcome to Hacker Whacker: Access Denied, an extension on the original whack-a-mole style game Hacker Whacker. Three developers were involved in creating the original and are credited in the Team section. Of those three, only Barrie Millar is involved in this expansion.

The original game was created during Hackathon 2 of Code Institute's "16-Week High-Performance Full Stack Skills Bootcamp" which ranged from 02/07/2024 (from 9am) to 04/07/2024 (up to 1.30pm). The purpose of this extension is to progress the project beyond the scope of the assessment and to add features that the developers originally wanted to include.

# Added Features

Hacker Whacker: Access Denied makes the following changes from the original Hacker Whacker game:-

- The project logos have been re-branded as is fitting for a new project. Other changes have been made to update the game page to a style reflected in the new project.
- Usability updates have been made to improve the user experience. For example, clicking the game logo text no longer sends the user back to the main menu and potentially interrupting their game.
- A game settings page has been added to allow the user to enable or disable new features.
- New Switchable Game Mode: Ethical Hackers - Hackers with shields appear, representing ethical hackers examining your system. Clicking them costs you 20 points, adding a new dimension to the fast-paced game.
- New Switchable Game Mode: Speed Mode - Five different speeds have been added to slow down and speed up the game according to the user preference. The default is the middle speed of the five.
- Sounds have been added to promote user immersion in the game.
- The in-game instructions have been naturally updated.
- A version number has been added to all screens in the game after the project reached mature status.
